# Temi complete installation
** the whole steps for robot "Temi" installation.**
** Chinese version will be done in the future.**

## Environment
- python3
- ubuntu 20

## Set up a vitual env first
$: `python3 -m venv temi-env`
"tem-env" could change to the name you prefer.

$: `source temi-env/bin/activate`
to activate your virtual env

## Use pytemi to manipulate temi
Please refer to the link to clone or install pytemi:
<https://github.com/applejenny66/pytemi>

## build up the java environment
Because pytemi is not very powerful now, we need to write some java or kotlin codes to get more information from temi.
Here we choose java instead of kotlin.
